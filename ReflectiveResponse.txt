What unique challenges do you foresee in developing and integrating AI regulatory agents 
for legal compliance from a full-stack perspective? 
- Document variation
    - My current Regex solution separates the text and enumerations, which is sufficient for uniquely citing passages of text. 
    - A better solution would also differentiate titles from text, and would be amenable to other types of enumeration, 
        such as alphabetical enumerations. 
    - This solution also confused the Document Title in 2 ways: The document title property, 'got_laws', was injected into the 
        stream. But also, the visually-apparent document title, 'Laws of the Seven Kingdoms', was merged in with other texts. 
        A more robust solution would differentiate document titles from document text. 
    - AWS Textract was able to selectively itemize each element, so integrating with that could improve performance. 

- Citations not being reconciled

How would you address these challenges to make the system robust and user-friendly?
